# NRaaS-retuner-Package

* What this retuner package contains is basically "fixing" some of the Isla Paradiso issues with autonomy of controlling houseboats.
  
* A modded pregnancy length each pregnancy now lasts 15 days and they only start walking pregnant near birth this hopefully gives your pregnant sims more mobility, modded twins and triplets chance.

* To coincide with the modded pregnancy lengths I also enabled most actions for pregnant sims so they should be able to ice skate and or snowboard you may need mods to not make them look "weird" else your pregnant sim will be the most "useless" sim outside of being able to write novels and or paint and general housework outside of cleaning litter boxes.
  
* A nearly complete overhaul of the time to upgrade stuff with handiness skill all appliances start at a base of 10 sim minutes with +10 sim minutes for each difficulty added repair times are also significantly overhauled to be as long as 15-30-ish sim minutes (hopefully I have all appliances covered).
  
* Nearly overhauls the hobbies to be nearly "unfailured" state IE Alchemy tables are faster to produce stuff at a certain point and should not fail maybe the sculpting table as well, also nearly guarantee success of cloning items with the science table. (search for Hobbies)
  
* A near overhaul of the romance visibility and challenges to be much more "linient" for 2 timing sims. the price is that Faithful and Eternally faithful moodlets may not actually appear. (check Socializing.RomanceVisibility)
