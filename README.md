# NRaaS-retuner-Package

* What this retuner package contains is basically "fixing" some of the Isla Paradiso issues with autonomy of controlling houseboats.
  
* A modded pregnancy length each pregnancy now lasts 15 days and they only start walking pregnant near birth this hopefully gives your pregnant sims more mobility, modded twins and triplets chance.
  
* A nearly complete overhaul of the time to upgrade stuff with handiness skill all appliances start at a base of 10 sim minutes with +10 sim minutes for each difficulty added repair times are also significantly overhauled to be as long as 15-30-ish sim minutes (hopefully I have all appliances covered).
  
* Nearly overhauls the hobbies to be nearly "unfailured" state IE Alchemy tables are faster to produce stuff at a certain point and should not fail maybe the sculpting table as well, also nearly guarantee success of cloning items with the science table. (search for Hobbies)
  
* A near overhaul of the romance visibility and challenges to be much more "linient" for 2 timing sims. the price is that Faithful and Eternally faithful moodlets may not actually appear. (check Socializing.RomanceVisibility)
